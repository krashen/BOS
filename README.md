## Synopsis

This is a simple game of guessing if the next number will be bigger or smaller within the range [1-100].

## Motivation

I found out about ReactJs and Redux and I wanted to do something with them. Hopefully it will be the first of many

## Installation

To run the game:
 - Install the dependencies
 
 If you want to try it locally and do not have a server running:
 - Install http-server
 - Move to src/client/
 - Run http-server ./
 - Browser to localhost:8080

## Contributors

Any improvement that you want to add to the game and/or code in general is welcomed :)
